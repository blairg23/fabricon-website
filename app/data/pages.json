Though we focus and use a few choice fabrics, there are many resources that are virtually endless when it comes to our background. <br /><br />Our construction techniques include sewn, welded or chemical bonding matching the construction technique that provides the desired outcome. <br /><br />We work with and explore the most overlooked construction materials available, fabric.

Few materials can truly show superiority when deployed and used correctly enabling improvised solutions not available or found in other types of construction methods. <br /><br />Foremost, it\u2019s fabric\u2019s flexibility that allows for creative shapes in design, the ability to be deployable and used at multiple locations. <br />Second is Translucency allowing views to the sky and soft daylight to come through lowering the need for consumptive artificial lighting in the daytime while using nighttime lighting that turns projects iconic. <br /><br />Todays technical fabrics and films are arriving in endless varieties which can be engineered <br />to the demands put on them.
