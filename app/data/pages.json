They can be manufactured for the specific needs of the customer. From full to semi enclosed spaces, Frame supported fabric structures come in all shapes and size. With the use of modern day fabrics like PTFE, ETFE and HDPE the expected life span is comparable to traditional used construction methods. Frame structures are designed to support the fabric and its external loads. The frames generally designed to be stable regardless of whether fabric is attached or not. While the frame is not dependent on the fabric for its stability fabric can contribute to that stability. Some of the oldest frame structures used by humans are the tipis of North America and the Yurts or Kibitz of North central Asia which still find common use today as living quarters.

With today\u2019s modern fabrics like PTFE, ETFE and PVC these structures are expected to last longer than traditional construction materials. All while creating energy savings through the translucent nature of these fabrics. True tensile structure is one where the entire matrix of the fabric is in tension. Loss of tension can result in damage to the fabric and loss of stability even though the frame is engineered to support itself. Ideally it curves equally in opposite directions and develops 3D stability. Flatter panels need greater loads on the material to keep its shape. The frame systems used in these structures can be a single unique type Umbrella Mast\u2026 or a hybrid of an open or closed systems. Tension structures often incorporate Tensegrity shapes into its function. Whether deployable or permanent selecting fabric as a primary material offers distinct advantages over other forms of construction. Distinct advantages include flexibility in shapes, the ability to span large areas under extreme loads, outstanding translucency, and light weight low site impact. It is the proven choice for habitable shelters in some of the most extreme climate/weather conditions on the planet. We can help you at every stage of your fabric product from determining design feasibility to the development of shape/model incorporating non linear analysis to determine loads and ultimately installation of the final product.  <br /></p>", "links": [], "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/7fc56270e7a70fa81a5935b72eacbe29.JPG", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/207a192a1b1110c866e86268f992fd11.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/624b4beaf79ee1ddf042ed0fa9583226.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/ff41f8b13dc604b3caa956f790333a16.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/130d8c71b15931d129c9ba4cb456dfc4.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/5f8efb577b4d32b242c36003d828fd74.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/8f84707f7b9aaf19cff197ae039c7e50.JPG", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/e793c2b6f4c144eb728eb6c3d7eb0176.JPG", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/ab8072638c72126c18f7a2e6d8fe0d03.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/90de59a7c64365fad32a270dd7ac5a53.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/316d229fe64bb136750cf4120c61a3b6.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/67c117dd7823b740a55c3d182c20470f.JPG"], "url": "/products/fabric_structures/tensile"}, "/products/awnings_and_canopies": {"title": "Awnings", "jumbotron": "Awnings and Canopies.

Our palette of fabrics consists of acrylics, cotton, glass, nylon, polyester, vinyls, PTFE and HDPE while our expertise and list of materials grows.<br /><br />While our focus is fabric, we continually integrate with many other materials whether that be aluminum, cable, concrete, steel, wood or composites. Our products and services cover tents and tipis made from cotton canvas, awnings and canopies of woven acrylics, polyesters and PVC\u2019s to sophisticated tensile and frame structures created from a wide array of films and fabrics chosen for performance and needs of situations encountered. Fabricon also provides metal bending/fabrication and decorating of the fabrics with various forms of signage. Our work can be seen throughout the Northwest and we have been a part of several international projects. <br /><br /><br />We excel at one of a kind bespoke designs by providing advanced preparation, careful planning and material choices. The world of technical fabrics is complex and rapidly changing as new materials and fabrication methods emerge. \"Smart Fabrics\" are playing an increasing role improving our lives while structurally engineered fabrics are being developed that can span immense spaces <br />and achieve life spans of 50 years. <br /><br />Mark, became a certified Master Fabric Craftsman in 1983 and received lifetime recognition as a Certified Master Fabric Craftsman in 2014 through the IFAI (www.ifai.com). <br /><br />Mark has served on the Board of Directors of the Fabric Structures Association from 2008 until 2016. Chairing it from 2012-2014. Our work has achieved 9 international achievement awards, most recently the Award of Excellence for a frame supported tensile structure on the Rosebud Tribal Veterans Cemetery in South Dakota and an Outstanding Achievement Award for a Tensile Canopy used as building entranceway at the University of Alaska Fairbanks. <br /><br />Mark began his career in 1975 making tribal tipis. Those tipis have been on display in the Smithsonian Museum in Washington, D.C., the Cody Museum in Cody, Wyoming, the Museum of Man in Toronto, Ontario Canada and the Little World Museum of Man in Japan. <br /><br />In 1978 Mark expanded his horizons to design and manufacturing horse packing gear and wall tents for professional outfitters. One of his favorite projects was supplying the military tents for the film Dances With Wolves.<br /><br />While still servicing Western Montana\u2019s awning needs from frame and fabric fabrication, high quality retractable awning and innovative fabric structures. <br /><br />Fabric has provided solutions to most of our needs since antiquity and a shelter few materials can truly show superiority when deployed and used correctly improvised solutions not available or found in other types. Today\u2019s technical fabrics and films are arriving in endless varieties which can be engineered to the demands put on them. Whether it be as lifesaving fuse in an animal tracking collar or a 200M free span structure we look for the correct material for the job.   <br /><br />Fabricon is here to help put together your next specialty fabric project.<br /><br /></p>", "links": [], "images": ["https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/66f76c87f47d352f4f4d17373205b8c3.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/624b4beaf79ee1ddf042ed0fa9583226.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/b5386c038c47bd8bcfe7f8109e6e7c2e.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/e357969093443c5c54450c04c26e29f4.jpg", "https://s3.amazonaws.com/fabricon-assets/img/4abb1aa6e47add0471eb47ad526b664f.jpg"], "url": "/about"}}
