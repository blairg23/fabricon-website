1. Product photo gallery (each photo or category has a gallery to slide through).
2. Update menu area (larger fonts, more padding, spread across screen)
3. Add new popout menu area on left side of screen (jquery popout) (maybe just icons with tooltips)
4. Update logo area (thinner logo [maybe 50% of current size], more stretch across screen, different fonts/colors, add motto) Try several designs and showcase each design separately. Possibly have black band w/ silver logo and gold lettering (add motto beneath lettering)
5. When a user clicks on a category or navigates to a content area, the template will be a large centered gallery photo to quickly scroll through content, as well as a blurb about that content area.
6. Populate "about fabricon" area.
7. Populate "contact us" area with google maps, contact info, email form
8. **Make left/right side of image in "gallery" clickable for navigation (instead of having to click on arrow specifically)** --> Conflicts with clicking image for page navigation.
9. Add Fabricon icon to upper-left of navigation bar.
10. Hide email from spambots (websitecodetutorials.com)
11. Style sheet switcher (websitecodetutorials.com)
12. Background image idea: play with fabric weaves (either in logo area only or in entire background)
13. Fonts: Arial? Play around with different fonts.
14. Front page and content pages: add more padding between thumbnail pictures, also change out placeholders for real content pictures (HD images)
15. Contact Us: Google maps, contact info, email us form
16. About Fabricon: Add content
17. Resources: Add content
18. Add social networking features: facebook, linkedin, and google+
19. Horizontal dividers between ALL menu items (maybe talk about this more with the customer)
